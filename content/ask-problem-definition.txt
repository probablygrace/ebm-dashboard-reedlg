# Problem Definition Framework

## X â†’ Y Framework
### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)
M&A Culture Integration: The approaches used to align organizational cultures during mergers and acquisitions (M&As), such as leadership communication and formal meetings.

### Desired State (Y - What outcome do we want to achieve?)
Positive Employee Perceptions: The measurable outcomes affected by cultural fragility during M&As, such as job satisfaction, organizational engagement and commitment, and perceived job security.

## PICOC Framework
### Population (Who is affected by this problem?)
Employees in mid- to large-sized companies undergoing M&As.

### Intervention (What solution/action are we considering?)
Cultural interation strategies, including leadership communication and formal meetings.

### Comparison (What alternatives exist?)
No formal or planned cultural integration plan.

### Outcomes (What will success look like?)
Increased employee engagement, trust, and organizational commitment, as well as stabilized perceived job security.

### Context (Where/when does this apply?)
Transition phase during company M&As.

## Clear Problem Statement
Company culture is susceptible to deterioration during mergers and acquisitions (M&As), becoming more negative and fragile due to misaligned values, unclear communication, and employee uncertainty.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
A flawed integration of company cultures during M&As can lead to a dysfunctional, failed transition.

### Stakeholder Impact
A flawed integration can lead to worsened business performance influenced by the dysfunctional work environment, negatively impacting financial performance and the overall stability and profitability of the business(es).

### Strategic Alignment
Successful cultural integration should be a top priority during M&As because it directly impacts company viability. It should not be assumed that the cultures will naturally integrate or that the cultures are "compatible enough" not to need a formalized integration plan.
