## Cross-Evidence Analysis

### Convergent Findings (Where Evidence Types Agree)

#### Strong Convergence
**Finding:** Enabling managers and running honest, frequent two‑way communication are the most reliable levers to protect culture and reduce attrition.
**Supporting Evidence Types:** Scientific, practitioner, organizational, and stakeholder evidence.
**Confidence Level:** High
**Implication:** Make manager enablement and communication cadence top priorities.

#### Moderate Convergence  
**Finding:** Early alignment of a short list of culture-bearing systems reduces mixed signals and rework.
**Supporting Evidence Types:** Practitioner and organizational evidence; scientific literature supports the idea but is less specific.
**Variation Notes:** Practitioner evidence tends to highlight which systems to prioritize (e.g., performance management, recognition, onboarding), while organizational evidence emphasizes when alignment should happen and how misaligned policies show up in attrition or engagement data. Scientific literature supports the principle of system alignment but doesn’t specify the exact systems or sequencing, focusing more broadly on the importance of consistency between artifacts and desired culture.
**Implication:** Run a focused systems alignment sprint for the highest-impact areas.

### Divergent Findings (Where Evidence Types Disagree)

#### Major Divergence
**Issue:** How centralized integration decisions should be versus local autonomy.
**Scientific Evidence Says:** Central frameworks with local adaptation work well when local context is considered.
**Practitioner Evidence Says:** Some push for fast central decisions; others for local control to protect culture.
**Organizational Evidence Says:** Local autonomy can help retention but slows standardization.
**Stakeholder Evidence Says:** Clarity about decision rights and predictable processes.

**Possible Explanations for Disagreement:**
- Context differences: Different industries, geographies, and deal sizes shape whether centralized or local autonomy works best. For example, highly regulated sectors may need more central control, while creative or decentralized organizations thrive with local adaptation.
- Timing factors: Evidence collected at different stages of integration can lead to conflicting conclusions. Early-phase studies often emphasize speed and centralization, while later-phase observations highlight the importance of local autonomy for sustaining culture.
- Bias influences: Consultants or executives may favor approaches that align with their own operating models or strategic priorities, creating skewed recommendations. Employees and managers may emphasize autonomy due to lived experience of top-down decisions.
- Quality differences: Scientific studies tend to be more rigorous but less context-specific, while practitioner evidence is rich in detail but anecdotal. Organizational data may be limited in scope, and stakeholder input can reflect perception rather than measurable outcomes.

**Resolution Approach:** Adopt a hybrid governance model that centralizes decisions critical for fairness, compliance, and speed, while delegating operational adaptations to local managers within clear guardrails. This balances the strengths of each evidence type, reduces risk of message fragmentation, and allows flexibility without sacrificing consistency.

#### Minor Divergence
**Issue:** Best frequency for pulse surveys.
**Resolution Approach:** Use short biweekly pulses for leading signals and monthly deeper pulses for trends to avoid survey fatigue.

### Evidence Gaps

#### Critical Gaps
**Gap 1:** Longitudinal causal evidence linking specific manager enablement tactics to retention in M&A settings.
- **Impact on Decision:** Hard to predict exact retention gains.
- **Mitigation Strategy:** Pilot manager kits in a representative unit and measure results quickly.

**Gap 2:** Role-level risk maps for critical talent across both organizations.
- **Impact on Decision:** Hard to target retention and engagement efforts precisely.
- **Mitigation Strategy:** Do a rapid critical-role inventory and targeted manager interviews in weeks 1–4.

#### Minor Gaps
**Gap:** Clear cost–benefit numbers for sequencing system harmonization.
**Mitigation Strategy:** Run scenario models with conservative assumptions and update after the first sprint.

## Evidence-Based Problem Refinement

### Original Problem Statement
Culture erosion during M&A causes disengagement, loss of key people, and slower synergy capture.

### Evidence-Refined Problem Statement  
Culture erosion is mainly driven by inconsistent local messaging, overloaded middle managers, and misaligned culture-bearing systems. These factors speed up rumor spread and voluntary exits unless we enable managers, tighten communication, and prioritize system alignment.

**Key Refinements:**
- **Scope Changes:** Focus on targeted manager and systems interventions during the integration window rather than broad culture programs.
- **Root Cause Updates:** Manager capacity and message fragmentation are the immediate drivers.
- **Impact Reassessment:** Short-term attrition and productivity dips are the most actionable.
- **Stakeholder Effects:** Middle managers are the main leverage point; employees need role-level clarity; executives need people metrics in governance.

## Evidence-Based Solution Development

### Original Solution Concept
A sequenced culture integration program combining communication, manager enablement, systems alignment, and feedback loops.

### Evidence-Informed Solution Design
The solution has evolved to emphasize rapid manager enablement, disciplined two‑way communication, and a focused sprint to align the most influential culture-bearing systems, supported by hybrid governance that balances central decisions with local adaptation.

**Scientific Evidence Contributions:**
- **Design Elements:** Include leader modeling, frequent pulse surveys, transparent communication, and structured feedback loops.
- **Implementation Approaches:** Pilot interventions in representative units, measure outcomes, and scale iteratively.
- **Success Factors:** Manager capability, communication cadence discipline, and visible loop-closing are crucial for success.

**Practitioner Evidence Contributions:**
- **Practical Modifications:** Use manager kits (FAQs, talk tracks, decision trees), townhalls plus small-group Q&A, and “you said, we did” updates.
- **Implementation Lessons:** Prioritize time-boxed sprints for system alignment and protect manager time for coaching.
- **Avoiding Pitfalls:** Avoid over-communicating without system changes and resist one-size-fits-all scripts.

**Organizational Evidence Contributions:**  
- **Resource Requirements:** Allocate analytics support, communication capacity, and manager coaching hours.
- **Timing Considerations:** Focus on the first 12 weeks post-deal for foundational work aligned with integration milestones.
- **Readiness Assessment:** Use manager readiness surveys and communication channel analytics to determine sequencing and scale.

**Stakeholder Evidence Contributions:**
- **Stakeholder Support Elements:** Provide role-level clarity, transparent rationales, and visible responsiveness to feedback.
- **Resistance Management:** Engage informal leaders early and offer targeted retention paths for critical roles.
- **Communication Needs:** Share clear timelines, decision rights, and escalation paths at predictable intervals.
