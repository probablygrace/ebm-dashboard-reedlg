# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data & Performance Metrics

## Data Collection Summary
**Data Sources Accessed:** 12 sources (HRIS, ERP, CRM, financial systems, employee engagement surveys, quarterly HR dashboards, customer satisfaction reports, internal audit findings, leadership alignment assessments, prior M&A integration reports)
**Data Quality Assessment:** High overall quality (validated survey instruments, audited financials, reliable HRIS data; moderate limitations in qualitative cultural observations)

## Performance Metrics Analysis

### Problem-Related Metrics

#### Metric 1: Voluntary Employee Turnover
- **Current Value:** 18% (annualized)
- **Historical Trend (12 months):** Declining engagement → turnover rising from 12% to 18%
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Industry benchmark ~12% (SHRM data)
- **Problem Connection:** Demonstrates cultural misalignment and employee disengagement post‑M&A, especially among critical talent.
- **Data Source:** HRIS, quarterly HR dashboards
- **Data Quality:** High (validated HRIS records)

#### Metric 2: Employee Engagement Score
- **Current Value:** 62% favorable responses
- **Historical Trend (12 months):** Declining (from 72% to 62%)
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Internal target ≥70% engagement; industry average ~68%
- **Problem Connection:** Confirms morale drop and lack of trust in leadership during integration.
- **Data Source:** Annual employee engagement survey
- **Data Quality:** Medium (survey response rate 65%)

#### Metric 3: Productivity Index (Output per FTE)
- **Current Value:** 0.85 (vs. baseline 1.0)
- **Historical Trend (12 months):** Declining steadily since merger announcement
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Target productivity index ≥1.0
- **Problem Connection:** Indicates operational disruption and reduced discretionary effort linked to cultural stress.
- **Data Source:** ERP operational reports
- **Data Quality:** High (ERP validated data)

## Employee/HR Data Analysis

### Workforce Metrics
- **Employee Turnover Rate:** 18% (annualized)
- **Employee Satisfaction Scores:** 62% favorable, declining trend
- **Absenteeism Rate:** 6% (up from 4%)
- **Training Hours per Employee:** 18 hours annually
- **Internal Promotion Rate:** 8% (below target 12%)

### Problem-Specific HR Impacts
- **Departments Most Affected:** R&D and customer service show highest turnover and absenteeism
- **Skill Gap Analysis:** Leadership alignment and communication skills lacking in middle management
- **Change Readiness Assessment:** Moderate; employees show willingness to adapt but require clarity and trust

## Synthesis of Organizational Evidence

### Strongest Evidence for Problem Existence
Rising turnover (18%), declining engagement (62%), and productivity drop (0.85 vs. 1.0 baseline) clearly demonstrate cultural integration challenges.

### Strongest Evidence for Solution Feasibility  
Budget allocation ($2.5M), HR integration team capacity (8 FTEs), and leadership endorsement provide strong feasibility signals.

### Evidence-Based Organizational Readiness Assessment
Organization shows moderate readiness: resources and leadership support are present, but employee morale and trust must be rebuilt.

### Critical Success Factors Based on Internal Evidence
- Transparent communication cadence
- Leadership alignment and credibility
- Rapid onboarding and retention programs
- Dedicated HR integration resources
- Measurement of engagement, turnover, and productivity alongside financial KPIs
