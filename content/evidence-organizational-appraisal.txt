# Organizational Evidence: Quality Assessment

## Overall Data Quality Assessment

### Data Source Reliability

#### Primary Data Sources
**Data Source 1:** HR Information System (HRIS – turnover, engagement, demographics)
- **Reliability Rating:** High
- **Data Collection Method:** Automated system entries, employee surveys, exit interviews
- **Update Frequency:** Monthly dashboards, quarterly survey cycles
- **Historical Availability:** 5 years of reliable records
- **Known Limitations:** Survey participation rates vary; qualitative sentiment not fully captured

**Data Source 2:** ERP/Operations System (productivity, efficiency, error rates)
- **Reliability Rating:** High
- **Data Collection Method:** Automated workflow tracking, production logs
- **Update Frequency:** Real-time with monthly roll-ups
- **Historical Availability:** 3–5 years of operational data
- **Known Limitations:** Productivity measures may not isolate cultural factors; external shocks (supply chain) can distort

**Data Source 3:** Employee Engagement Surveys (annual + pulse surveys)
- **Reliability Rating:** Medium
- **Data Collection Method:** Anonymous online surveys, pulse checks
- **Update Frequency:** Annual full survey, quarterly pulse surveys
- **Historical Availability:** 3 years of consistent data
- **Known Limitations:** Response bias (employees reluctant to criticize), lower participation in acquired units

### Bias Assessment

#### Selection Bias
**Data Availability Bias:** 
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Issue:** Missing data from acquired units with low survey participation
- **Impact:** May understate disengagement severity

**Survivorship Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Issue:** Focus on retained employees; departing talent not fully represented
- **Impact:** Skews morale upward

**Reporting Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Issue:** Limited incentive to manipulate HRIS/ERP data
- **Impact:** Automated systems, audit checks

## Overall Organizational Evidence Assessment

### Strengths of Organizational Evidence
- Reliable HRIS and ERP data with long historical records
- Clear alignment of metrics with cultural integration problem (turnover, engagement, productivity)
- Strong external validation against industry benchmarks
- Consistent measurement across multiple systems
- Predictive value for synergy realization and customer outcomes

### Limitations of Organizational Evidence
- Survey participation bias and selective reporting
- Limited qualitative insights into cultural sentiment
- Missing data from departing employees (survivorship bias)
- Confounding external factors (economic cycles, supply chain disruptions)
- Definitions of “engagement” vary across systems

### Confidence Level for Decision-Making
**Overall Confidence:** High
**Justification:** HRIS and ERP provide robust quantitative evidence; surveys add context but require cautious interpretation. Triangulation across systems strengthens confidence despite biases.

### Recommendations for Data Improvement
- Increase survey participation in acquired units (incentives, anonymity assurances)
- Collect exit interview data systematically to reduce survivorship bias
- Standardize engagement definitions across systems/vendors
- Incorporate qualitative sentiment analysis (focus groups, interviews)
- Enhance integration of HRIS and ERP dashboards for real-time monitoring
